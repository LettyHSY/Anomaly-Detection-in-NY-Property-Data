### Anomaly-Detection-in-NY-Property-Data
#### Programming language: Python
#### Project Goal
The purpose of this project is to find potential property tax fraud going on in NYC using the NY property dataset. The dataset consists of financial, geographic, and other information about each property. The city of NY wants an algorithmic system that can look through their one million property records to find potential tax fraud. The kind of fraud they’re looking for is people underpaying tax or otherwise misrepresenting their property characteristics. We looked for anomalies in the data by investigating which properties’ assessed values are too low or too high and listed the 10 properties with the highest fraud score.
